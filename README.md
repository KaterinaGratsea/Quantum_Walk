# Quantum_Walk

We study the generation of hybrid entanglement in a one-dimensional quantum walk. In particular, we explore the preparation of maximally entangled states between position and spin degrees of freedom (see below).

We address it as an optimization problem, where the cost function is the Schmidt norm. We attach the average Schmidt norm during the walk (a) and the average amplitude distribution of the final state (b) over 10.000 random initializations.
